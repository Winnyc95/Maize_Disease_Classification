# Maize Disease Classification
End-to-end deep learning project using a CNN model to identify maize diseases through maize leaves.
## Project goal:
Diseases are largely responsible for the low maize yields,  accurate identification of diseases that attack maize leaves will enable farmers manage their crops effectively and achieve good yields.
## Solution:
By obtaining labelled images of maize leaf diseases, a CNN model is trained to accurately classify the images as having Grey Spot, Northern Leaf Blight, Common Rust or healthy. The model is then deployed as a streamlit app and can be accessed by farmers.
## Model building
* Data Collection: 
* Modelling: Tensorflow, Keras, CNN
